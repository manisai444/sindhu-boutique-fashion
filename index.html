        A boutique (French: [butik]) is a retail shop that deals in high end fashionable clothing or accessories.[1] The
        word is French for "shop", which derives ultimately from the Ancient Greek ἀποθήκη (apothēkē)
        "storehouse".[2][3]

        The term boutique and also designer refer (with some differences) to both goods and services,[4] which are
        containing some element that is claimed to justify an extremely high price.

        Etymology and usage
        The term boutique entered common English parlance in the late 1960s.[citation needed]

        Some multi-outlet businesses (Chain stores) can be referred to as boutiques if they target small, upscale niche
        markets.[5] Although some boutiques specialize in hand-made items and other unique products, others simply
        produce T-shirts, stickers, and other fashion accessories in artificially small runs and sell them at high
        prices.

        Agribusiness is the industry, enterprises, and the field of study[1] of value chains in agriculture[2] and in
        the bio-economy,[3] in which case it is also called bio-business[4][5] or bio-enterprise. The primary goal of
        agribusiness is to maximize profit while satisfying the needs of consumers for products related to natural
        resources such as biotechnology, farms, food, forestry, fisheries, fuel, and fiber.

        Studies of business growth and performance in farming have found successful agricultural businesses are
        cost-efficient internally and operate in favorable economic, political, and physical-organic environments. They
        are able to expand and make profits, improve the productivity of land, labor, and capital, and keep their costs
        down to ensure market price competitiveness.[6]

        Agribusiness is not limited to farming. It encompasses a broader spectrum through the agribusiness system which
        includes input supplies, value-addition, marketing, entrepreneurship, microfinancing, and agricultural
        extension.

        In some countries like the Philippines, creation and management of agribusiness enterprises require consultation
        with registered agriculturists above a certain level of operations, capitalization, land area, or number of
        animals in the farm.
        The term value chain was first popularized in a book published in 1985 by Michael Porter,[18] who used it to
        illustrate how companies could achieve what he called “competitive advantage” by adding value within their
        organization. Subsequently, the term was adopted for agricultural development purposes [19] and has now become
        very much in vogue among those working in this field, with an increasing number of bilateral and multilateral
        aid organisations using it to guide their development interventions.
